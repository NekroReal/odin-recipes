        <li> 30 ounces ricotta cheese </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>

        <li> 1 pound thinly sliced mozzarella cheese </li>
        <li> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul> <br>
    <h3> Steps to follow </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. <br>
             Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic <br>
             and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, <br>
             fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed<br>
             tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer.<br>
             Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally. </li> <br>

        <li> Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over<br>
             the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water.<br>
             Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water. </li> <br>

        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley,<br>
             1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna. </li> <br>

        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan. </li> <br>

        <li> To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan.<br>
             Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>
             Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,<br>
             then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create<br>
             three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup<br>
             of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br>
             Cover loosely with aluminum foil. </li> <br>

        <li> Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes<br>
             to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot. </li> <br>
    </ol>
