    <h2> Ingredients </h2> <br>

    <ul>
        <li> 100g pancetta </li> <br>
        
        <li> 50g pecorino cheese </li> <br>
        
        <li> 50g parmesan </li> <br>
        
        <li> 3 large eggs </li> <br>
        
        <li> 350g spaghetti </li> <br>
        
        <li> 2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole </li> <br>
        
        <li> 50g unsalted butter </li> <br>
        
        <li> sea salt and freshly ground black pepper </li> <br>
    </ul> <br>

    <h2> Steps to follow </h2> <br>

    <ol>
        <li> Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. </li> <br>

        <li> Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g <br>
             pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together. </li> <br>

        <li> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black <br>
             pepper. Set everything aside. </li> <br>

        <li> Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes <br>
             back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until <br>
             al dente (just cooked). </li> <br>

        <li> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. </li> <br>

        <li> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. <br>
             Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter <br>
             has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic. </li> <br>

        <li> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta <br>
             is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with <br>
             a slotted spoon and discard. </li> <br>

        <li> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water <br>
             with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. <br>
             Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) <br>
             and don't throw the pasta water away yet. </li> <br>

        <li> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. </li> <br>

        <li> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. <br>
             Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, <br>
             which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated. </li> <br>

        <li> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). <br>
             You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. </li> <br>

        <li> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. <br>
             Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. <br>
             If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta <br>
             water and the glossy sauciness will be revived. </li> <br>
    </ol> <br>
